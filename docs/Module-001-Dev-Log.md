-->
- [✅] Come up with a studio idea and complete the studio brainstorm assignment

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Summarize completed tasks or progress made.
  - <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
  I was able to successfully set up a Github webpage and get everything working just as shown in the lecture, and I was able to activate Github Education as well. 
  I also got my Discord set up with the Learn site and joined the class
  Discord server with the applicable roles. Finally, the big one was completing the Studio Brainstorm which proved to be a bit more difficult than I anticipated.
- **Challenges faced**:
  - Describe blockers, bugs, or issues encountered.

   When I first tried to join Github Education, I actually got rejected for some reason but fortunately I was eventually able to get in. It was pretty difficult to come up with good
   ideas for my studio while I was working on the brainstorm assignment so some ideas may not be the most creative, but I did my best. Also when I was designing the logo, my laptop crashed
   a few times for some reason and I lost everything I worked on, so I had to start over a few times which set me back a little and was also a little annoying. 
- **Solutions**:
  - Detail how you addressed challenges or your thought process.

  When Github rejected my application, they told me why I was rejected. So I did what they suggested I do and applied again, then after a few days I was approved to get in. It wasn't too bad.
  As for coming up with ideas, I did end up searching Google for information on existing game studios to draw some inspiration from them. For example, the name Flareware was pretty heavily
  inspired by Bioware. I based my company values on things I feel studios should be doing today, but just choose not to for whatever reason. The goal was to create the ideal game studio to make
  everyone happy. For designing the logo, I opted for a more simple design but I didn't want it to be straight up boring. So after a bit of tweaking and experimenting I was eventually able to 
  come up with something that satisfied me for the most part. I would like to do more with it, but I didn't want to spend too much time on the logo. I spent a lot of time changing colors, sizes,
  designs, etc. I drew the FLARE part by hand, but just used text for the Ware part since I wanted it to be more simple. For the A and R, I spent a bit of time trying to decide whether or not 
  I should put the holes in. After trying it out, I ended up no liking how it looked with the holes so I chose to leave it closed as a stylistic choice. The A and R are still recognizable enough
  so it's not confusing.

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"

Come up with an idea/plan for a game to work on throughout the semester. Also plan on getting the necessary materials to build whatever I need for my project.
