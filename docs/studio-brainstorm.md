## Unique Selling Point (USP)
*What will make your games stand out from others, particularly in the indie/board game space?*

> [Describe your USP, such as unique mechanics, storytelling integration, or player interaction.]
Our games will stand out because they wont be afraid to try and be their own thing. Each game will experiment with different mechanics to spice up the gameplay of the game, and will take feedback from the players to ensure we're making the games people want to play. Every game will have some kind of story whether it be big or small just to have something to make the game more interesting for the player. Not all games need a story, but we believe that having one anyway will be a nice bonus even if it's not the craziest story. Sometimes just a little bit of background is all the story you need. The multiplayer aspect of the games will be mostly competitive in nature, but fair for all players (i.e. no one player will have any advantage over the other).
