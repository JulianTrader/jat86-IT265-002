- [x] Complete What makes a game bad? Case Study
- [x] Brainstorm some ideas for my project

#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - Some ideas I came up with was something like a board game where the players would press a button in the center, then a few balls would fall
    in specific holes to earn points. There would be different areas on the board with different colors, where the different colors would
    correspond to different points. It would be kind of like skee ball except you don't throw the balls and its a bit more random.
  - I was able to come up with 3 bad games for the discussion with several reasons for why they're bad, as well what I'd do to fix it. I also
    made a meaningful reply responding to another person's post. 
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  It was a little difficult to come up with "bad games" and even harder to come up with the reasons why the games are bad and how to fix them
     Also I'm having a little trouble visualizing how it'll look but I think I have some good ideas of how I could do it, but I guess I'll see
     once I get there.
- **Solutions**:
  -  I generally thought about games I know of that have some pretty bad qualities to them and thought about why they're bad and what I woud do
     to fix them. There are many games I've seen on YouTube where people review a game and discuss how bad they are. I used my knowledge from that
     to develop my analysis on the games and why they're bad and what would be best for them. I also just used my own experience with games I
     don't really enjoy as much as other people and thought about why I don't enjoy them. I also asked my friend for a bit of help too to get
     another perspective.

#### Learnings
-  It was pretty interesting to see what games other people chose as their "bad games" and seeing their reasoning. I may not have agreed with
   everything, but that's what makes it so cool because we all have different thoughts about different games and interpret them differently in
   different way.

#### Free Thinking
-  Thinking about my project is interesting because I really don't know how it would turn out. Right now it's just an idea and I have no idea if it'll
   work or be as cool as I think it is. It's a little worried, but I'm excited to get started on it and see how it comes out. I still do want to
   try to come up with a few more ideas to spice up the game and see what happens.

#### Next Steps
