- [x] Find and play chosen Atari game
- [x] Complete Case Study Assignment on my chosen Atari game
#### Progress
- **What I accomplished**:
  - I was able to find and play my Atari game online. I played the game for a little while but I took me a little 
  while to understand how the game works. I was also able to find a nice video on the game that helped me a lot in my research and 
  understanding of the game. I found a few good sites for information on the game to help me complete the Case Study.
  - I completed all of the questions given in the Case Study. it took a lot longer than anticipated, but I'm pretty happy with what I was
    able to find and come up with.
- **Challenges faced**:
  -  When I first played the game, I couldn't figure out how to actually play the game. No matter what button I pressed, nothing would happen so
  I thought the game didn't work. I tried the game on a few different websites all with the same results so I was stuck for a bit until I was able 
  to figure out how it works.
- **Solutions**:
  -  The video I found gave me a better idea of how the game is supposed to work and I quickly realized what I was doing wrong. After viewing the video
  again, I tried the game again and was able to actually play the game for awhile.

#### Learnings
- Key insights, techniques, or concepts explored.
- I learned a lot about the Atari and the games it played. The hardware limitations did limit the possibilities of the games so they had to be kept
relatively simple and Spider-Man was no exception. The game is extremely simple, but it still manages to stand out thanks to innovative programming
and ideas. That's what makes things like this so cool to me because the developers need to get really creative to work around the limmitations of
the consoles. This doesn't go just for the Atari, but for all consoles and hardware in general. 

#### Free Thinking
-  N/A <!--Your entry here or N/A if not applicable for this entry-->
<!--

- Example prompts:
  - "What if the player interactions were asynchronous instead of real-time?"
  - "How could ECS improve performance in this system?"
  - "Does my current design support scalability? How can it improve?"
  
-->

#### Next Steps
- Continue learning about Game Development ideas and come up with ideas for my project.
